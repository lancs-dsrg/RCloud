# RCloud
RCloud Presentation - Lucy Morgan

Main Outcomes - 

RCloud looks like a promising piece of software and we can see how useful it would be for use with people who do not have a coding back ground so they don't have to download lots of things to be able to see the report you've made in RMarkdown or RShiny.

It does have its drawbacks - only usable on Google Chrome, no local copy available on Linux or Windows currently. Lots of failed code on the website.

Verdict - we should check how it's working in a few months to see if these problems have been addressed.
